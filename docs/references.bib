	abstract = {A central dogma of mammalian reproductive biology is that the size of the primordial follicle pool represents reproductive capacity in females. The assembly of the primordial follicle starts after the primordial germ cells (PGCs)-derived oocyte releases from the synchronously dividing germline cysts. PGCs initiate meiosis during fetal development. However, after synapsis and recombination of homologous chromosomes, they arrest at the diplotene stage of the first meiotic prophase (MI). The diplotene-arrested oocyte, together with the surrounding of a single layer of flattened granulosa cells, forms a basic unit of the ovary, the primordial follicle. At the start of each estrous (animal) or menstrual cycle (human), in response to a surge of luteinizing hormone (LH) from the pituitary gland, a limited number of primordial follicles are triggered to develop into primary follicles, preantral follicles, antral follicles and reach to preovulatory follicle stage. During the transition from the preantral to antral stages, the enclosed oocyte gradually acquires the capacity to resume meiosis. Meiotic resumption from the prophase of MI is morphologically characterized by the dissolution of the oocyte nuclear envelope, which is generally termed the “germinal vesicle breakdown” (GVBD). Following GVBD and completion of MI, the oocyte enters meiosis II without an obvious S-phase and arrests at metaphase phase II (MII) until fertilization. The underlying mechanism of meiotic arrest has been widely explored in numerous studies. Many studies indicated that two cellular second messengers, cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) play an essential role in maintaining oocyte meiotic arrest. This review will discuss how these two cyclic nucleotides regulate oocyte maturation by blocking or initiating meiotic processes, and to provide an insight in future research.},

abstract = {Coordinated regulation of oocyte and ovarian follicular development is essential for fertility. In particular, the progression of meiosis, a germ cell-specific cell division that reduces the number of chromosomes from diploid to haploid, must be arrested until just before ovulation. Follicular somatic cells are well-known to impose this arrest, which is essential for oocyte–follicle developmental synchrony. Follicular somatic cells sustain meiotic arrest via the natriuretic peptide C/natriuretic peptide receptor 2 (NPPC/NPR2) system, and possibly also via high levels of the purine hypoxanthine in the follicular fluid. Upon activation by the ligand NPPC, NPR2, the predominant guanylyl cyclase in follicular somatic cells, produces cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), which maintains meiotic arrest after transfer to the oocyte via gap junctions. Here we report that both the NPPC/NPR2 system and hypoxanthine require the activity of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH), the rate-limiting enzyme required for the production of guanylyl metabolites and cGMP. Furthermore, oocyte-derived paracrine factors, particularly the growth differentiation factor 9–bone morphogenetic protein 15 heterodimer, promote expression of Impdh and Npr2 and elevate cGMP levels in cumulus cells. Thus, although the somatic compartment of ovarian follicles plays an essential role in the maintenance of oocyte meiotic arrest, as has been known for many years, this function of the somatic cells is surprisingly regulated by signals from the oocyte itself.}}

abstract = {The concentration of hypoxanthine in mouse follicular fluid has been estimated to be 2–4 mM, and although this concentration maintains meiotic arrest in fully grown mouse oocytes in vitro, oocyte maturation in vivo is not induced by a decrease in the concentration of this purine in follicular fluid (J. J. Eppig, P. F. Ward-Bailey, and D. L. Coleman, Biol. Reprod., 33, 1041–1049, 1985). In the present study, the effect of 2 mM hypoxanthine on oocyte growth and development in vitro was assessed and the ability of gonadotropins to stimulate oocyte maturation in the continued presence of hypoxanthine was determined. Oocyte-granulosa cell complexes were isolated from 10- to 11-day-old mice and cultured in the presence or absence of 2 mM hypoxanthine. Oocytes from 10- to 11-day-old mice are in mid-growth phase and, without further development, are incompetent of undergoing meiotic maturation. During a 12-day culture period the granulosa cell-enclosed oocytes approximately doubled in size and, regardless of the presence or absence of hypoxanthine, 50–70% developed competence to undergo germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD). Hypoxanthine promoted the continued association of oocytes with their companion granulosa cells during the 12-day culture period, and therefore had a beneficial effect on oocyte development. Most of the oocytes that acquired GVBD competence in the absence of hypoxanthine underwent spontaneous GVBD. In contrast, 95% of the GVBD-competent oocytes were maintained in meiotic arrest by hypoxanthine. Following withdrawal of the hypoxanthine after the 12-day culture, 75% of the GVBD-competent oocytes underwent GVBD. These results show that hypoxanthine, and/or its metabolites, maintains meiotic arrest in oocytes that grow and acquire GVBD competence in vitro. Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), but not luteinizing hormone or human chorionic gonadotropin, induced oocyte GVBD in the continued presence of hypoxanthine. FSH stimulated oocyte maturation at a significantly (P < 0.01) higher frequency than coculture of the granulosa cell-denuded oocytes with granulosa cells in the continued presence of hypoxanthine. FSH did not induce the maturation of denuded oocytes cocultured with granulosa cells. Similar results were obtained using oocyte-cumulus cell complexes isolated from 22-day-old mice wherein ovarian follicular development was promoted by injection of exogenous gonadotropin. Based on these results, is it hypothesized that GVBD was promoted in these culture systems by an FSH-induced positive signal from granulosa/cumulus cells, and not simply by deprivation from the meiosis-arresting action of hypoxanthine.}
